---

## Executive Summary

This report provides an in-depth comparative analysis of the Nifty 50's performance during the Modi Era (2014-2024) and the Manmohan Era (2004-2014). Key performance metrics such as Risk-Free Rate, XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return), Standard Deviation, and Sharpe Ratio are analyzed to assess the equity market returns and risk-adjusted performance under two different administrations.  

The findings highlight that while both periods showed robust equity market performance, the Modi Era exhibited superior risk-adjusted returns, despite higher volatility. This outcome can be attributed to consistent policy reforms and economic stability during the period.

1. **Modi Era (2014-2024):** A period characterized by structural reforms and investor optimism.  
2. **Manmohan Era (2004-2014):** An era marked by economic growth but overshadowed by global financial crises and domestic uncertainties.

### Insights
1. **Higher XIRR:** The Modi Era delivered higher equity returns, reflecting strong economic fundamentals and policy-driven growth.  
2. **Increased Volatility:** Despite higher returns, the Modi Era exhibited greater volatility (Standard Deviation: 23.69%), attributed to global uncertainties and rapid market expansions.  
3. **Improved Risk-Adjusted Returns:** A higher Sharpe Ratio (0.36) in the Modi Era indicates better compensation for the risk borne by investors compared to the Manmohan Era (Sharpe Ratio: 0.29).  
4. **Interest Rate Impact:** Lower risk-free rates in the Modi Era enhanced equity attractiveness, unlike the Manmohan Era, where higher rates diverted investments to fixed-income instruments.

## Conclusion

The comparative analysis underscores that equity markets during the Modi Era provided superior risk-adjusted returns despite increased volatility. This performance is attributed to policy-driven economic stability and investor-friendly reforms. Conversely, the Manmohan Era, though marked by strong GDP growth, faced headwinds from global crises and policy delays, leading to comparatively lower risk-adjusted returns.

Investors seeking better risk-reward trade-offs were likely more rewarded during the Modi Era, while the higher risk-free rates and market volatility during the Manmohan Era would have made debt instruments more attractive.
