##EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides a comparative analysis of the Nifty Index’s performance during two significant periods in India’s economic history—the Manmohan Era (2004-2014) and the Modi Era (2014-2024). By examining key metrics such as the risk-free rate, XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return), standard deviation, and Sharpe Ratio, we highlight the economic undercurrents that influenced equity markets during these periods. The findings indicate that while both eras delivered notable returns, the Modi Era showcased higher risk-adjusted performance, albeit with slightly elevated volatility.

##INTRODUCTION
The Nifty Index, representing the top 50 companies in India by market capitalization, serves as a benchmark for assessing the overall health of the Indian equity market. Economic policies, global conditions, and domestic factors significantly shape its performance. This report compares the Nifty’s performance during the leadership of two prominent Indian prime ministers: Dr. Manmohan Singh and Mr. Narendra Modi. By analyzing data-driven metrics, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of equity market dynamics in these contrasting economic landscapes.

##NIFTY PERFORMANCE: MODI ERA (2014-2024)
###KEY METRICS
•	Risk-Free Rate: 5.33%
•	XIRR: 13.79%
•	Standard Deviation: 23.69%
•	Sharpe Ratio: 0.36
###KEY FACTORS DRIVING PERFORMANCE
1.	Pro-Growth Economic Policies: The Modi government focused on fostering an investment-friendly environment through initiatives like ‘Make in India,’ infrastructure development, and tax reforms (e.g., the Goods and Services Tax). These policies enhanced investor confidence and contributed to sustained market growth.
2.	Global Liquidity and FDI Inflows: Amid favorable global liquidity conditions, India witnessed significant foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, bolstering equity markets.
3.	Low Inflation and Stable Monetary Policies: A relatively low inflation environment, combined with controlled repo rates, ensured a conducive atmosphere for market stability and growth.
4.	Technological Advancements and Market Penetration: Increased digitalization and the proliferation of retail investors expanded the market’s reach, amplifying participation and liquidity.
Despite these favorable conditions, the standard deviation of 23.69% suggests higher market volatility, indicative of occasional uncertainties during the period.

##NIFTY PERFORMANCE: MANMOHAN ERA (2004-2014)
###KEY METRICS
•	Risk-Free Rate: 6.59%
•	XIRR: 12.72%
•	Standard Deviation: 21.12%
•	Sharpe Ratio: 0.29
###KEY FACTORS DRIVING PERFORMANCE
1.	High Growth Amid Globalization: The Manmohan Era marked India’s integration into the global economy, with key milestones like the IT and services sector boom and robust GDP growth rates.
2.	High Volatility Due to Global Financial Crisis: The 2008 global financial meltdown caused significant disruptions in the equity markets, resulting in heightened volatility. However, the government’s fiscal stimulus measures enabled a steady recovery.
3.	Elevated Repo Rates: With an average risk-free rate of 6.59%, borrowing costs remained high, partially limiting corporate profitability and market returns.
4.	Commodities and Currency Fluctuations: Dependency on crude oil imports and currency volatility added to market instability, constraining investor confidence during certain periods.
The relatively lower standard deviation of 21.12% reflects comparatively moderate volatility, although risks remained pronounced during crisis years.

##COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: MODI ERA VS. MANMOHAN ERA

Parameter	Modi Era (2014-2024)	Manmohan Era (2004-2014)
Risk-Free Rate	5.33%	6.59%
XIRR	13.79%	12.72%
Standard Deviation	23.69%	21.12%
Sharpe Ratio	0.36	0.29
###KEY OBSERVATIONS
1.	Risk-Free Rate: The Modi Era benefited from a lower average risk-free rate (5.33%), reducing borrowing costs and encouraging equity investments. In contrast, the Manmohan Era faced higher rates (6.59%), reflecting tighter monetary policies.
2.	Returns (XIRR): The Modi Era outperformed with an XIRR of 13.79%, compared to 12.72% during the Manmohan Era, indicating superior wealth creation for equity investors.
3.	Volatility (Standard Deviation): While both periods experienced significant market fluctuations, the Modi Era exhibited slightly higher volatility (23.69% vs. 21.12%), likely due to global uncertainties and dynamic domestic reforms.
4.	Risk-Adjusted Performance (Sharpe Ratio): The Sharpe Ratio of 0.36 in the Modi Era surpasses the 0.29 of the Manmohan Era, highlighting better risk-adjusted returns under Modi’s leadership.

##CONCLUSION
The comparative analysis underscores that the Modi Era delivered stronger risk-adjusted returns, bolstered by pro-growth policies, global liquidity, and macroeconomic stability. However, this came at the cost of slightly higher market volatility. The Manmohan Era, while characterized by robust growth and globalization, faced challenges from elevated interest rates and global financial instability, which constrained its risk-adjusted performance.
Investors seeking to navigate equity markets must remain attuned to the interplay of economic policies, global conditions, and market dynamics. The findings reaffirm the importance of balancing returns with risks, emphasizing the value of diversified investment strategies across varying economic cycles.
